      <title>Raspberry Pi &#43; webcam = CCTV</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short story long: We get a box of veggies and fruit delivered at home and unfortunately, it has been pinched a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubt that a box of carrots and apples can look as appealing as an amazon box but it is very annoying to open the door and see that some moron has taken it home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here goes the geek in me to solve the issue: got a raspberry Pi, got an old webcam, got a CCTV installed at home in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the ones who want to do it: the trick is to download motion and compile it in the rbp (the apt-get install motion doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to work that well with loads of webcams).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not much else to do: plug the camera, compile &amp;amp; install motion, catch the thief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: as expected, now that I have my own CCTV system, the hungry has shown up&amp;#8230; or was put off by the green led blinking from the front window)&lt;/p&gt;
