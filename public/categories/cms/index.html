                        <p>This last week has been a bit crazy with all the new stuff that is going on but&#8230; if last week was mayhem, get ready because this week is hardware week.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will go to the <a href="https://london.hackspace.org.uk/">London Hackspace</a>  to see what do they do and <strong>IF</strong> it would make any sense to join them. I will unveil an idea that I&#8217;ve been working on for the last weeks. One of the things that I&#8217;ve learnt during these last 2 years is that no idea is good if no money can be made.</p>

<p>I agree that making money is &#8220;the business part&#8221; of the idea and I&#8217;ve been tempted to write a post about that in reply to a conversation that was triggered in Twitter by the fine people of Klicap. However, time is precious and &#8220;Talking is easy&#8221; so, my new motto is &#8220;<strong>Make More, Talk Less</strong>&#8221; (not that this many people are listening).</p>

<p>Super exciting times where I have to deal with Software and Hardware and the close relationship between them.</p>

<p>This pre-holidays week is all about hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arduino</li>
<li>Rapsberry Pis</li>
<li>NFC</li>
</ul>

<p>And :blibb that we could say it&#8217;s the glue that ties them together. As I said&#8230; Exciting!</p>

                        <p>If I talk about CMS everybody who knows the term will think of systems that allow you to manage your on-line assets. Woot? CMS is kind of a horrible term since it&#8217;s wrapped up in many layers of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>CMS is not a web design tool, CMS is not a magic factory to produce websites. CMS systems allow you to manage your content (not your website, do yo see the difference?). Unfortunately for us, humans, there&#8217;s nothing that allow us to manage our online content as consumers.</p>

<p>WordPress is great, suddenly the author of this blog can swap almost any little piece of this blog with a few clicks&#8230; however, the same author is really struggling to manage his bookmarks, rss feeds (now that Google Reader is walking the green mile), pictures, music, and the issue goes on.</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t you notice? it is your content, but it has turn into their business!</p>

<p>So, let me ask you this: when, as users, did we decide to delegate the responsibility of managing our on-line content on third parties that did whatever they liked / wanted?</p>

<p>Companies that when their time arrived, they left us all by the side of the road looking confused, lost and sad.</p>

<p>I agree, del.icio.us was great.. until they died. Nobody thought that Google would kill Reader but they did and now that uneasy feeling of me delegating my on-line content on third parties is turning into a terrible itch. My on-line resources are part of my business.</p>

<p>I am who I am and I do what I do because of my information.</p>

<p>Reader&#8217;s Assassination is the last straw. My content cannot be left in hands of companies that look at me as their way of making money. Turning Users into a comodity is a high risk game. I agree, not many people will desert all these Free Services (because they are free), but every time you use a free service remind yourself the price you will have to pay to move away. Sometimes, paying is the cheapest way to freedom.</p>

<p>Call me stupid but I&#8217;ve been building a CMS. A different kind of CMS, a CMS that allows me to manage my content. Perhaps it&#8217;s not as sparkly and shiny as all these other services, but look at this: it&#8217;s mine. I have total control over it. My content is nobody&#8217;s business any more.</p>

<p>This CMS is called :blibb and it&#8217;s a bit early to open it up to the masses but if you are interested on trying a very early version just let me know.</p>
