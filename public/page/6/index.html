                        <p>You have an idea, and that&#8217;s great, but now you need time to cook it, and bake it and let it rest, and then look at it again&#8230; Of course you don&#8217;t have time for anything, so, you just go like mad and jump into this new idea because it&#8217;s so great that you cannot understand how nobody has noticed it before, how no one has done anything before &#8230; And then you fail (it&#8217;s not quiet like that but I&#8217;ll save you a few lines of going nowhere).</p>

<p>You have an idea and then you wait, and then you talk to people and explain that idea. You see, my wife was right when she said that if you cannot explain an idea the idea is not that great. But how are you going to explain someone your new idea about quantum physics if nobody knows quantum physics&#8230; and this is the hardest lesson I&#8217;ve learnt these last two years:</p>

<p>If you cannot condense and explain your idea in plain language that everybody can understand, chances are that it&#8217;s not that great idea.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the idea can be incredible awesome, but you have to go over and over and over again to polish it off, to make it cristal clear. Then, and only then, it&#8217;s when it makes sense to go wild and try to create whatever your idea is all about.</p>

<p>The beauty of the whole thing is that no matter what, you will learn. Either by failing or by succeeding and that is, I think, the best of the whole situation.</p>

                        <p>Just after finishing the Mobile Apps. workshop for <a href="http://www.qmsu.org/">QME</a> I started thinking of the follow up. I sent them off asking them to think about the idea so when we meet up again they can talk about it in complete confidence. A paper prototype would be ideal, but we shall see.</p>

<p>Anyway, there I was coming back in the tube and then I thought &#8220;<strong>What if&#8230;</strong> I do the same&#8221;. Of course, I&#8217;m extremely busy already so, the  idea of making yet-another-app was beyond sanity. Still, by the following morning I had made the (cruel) decision to design, build and release an app&#8230; in less than a week.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m going to make an app under a week (and because I know myself quiet well) I&#8217;m going to release it before next Thursday. Not only that, I&#8217;ve made sure that there&#8217;s no much point of missing the deadline, because this app, my friends, it&#8217;s called &#8216;<strong>My Secret Valentine</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>As you can see, releasing a Valentine&#8217;s app on the 15th of Feb. is just idiotic. A classic example of Run or Die.</p>

<p>I did the paper prototype, in fact, I have 3 versions of the paper prototype (iterating it&#8217;s easier when you only have to scrap the paper and get a new fresh post-it).</p>

<p>Bear with me (and my new blog) I will posting updates pretty soon and yes, I will write about the whole process</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Yesterday I spent a few hours talking with the Queen Mary Entrepreneurs students. My main objective was to motivate those ones who had and idea to try and build a product. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve succeeded or not but while I was talking I had the idea of teaching by giving example&#8230; so, here&#8217;s the challenge.</p>

<p>Today it&#8217;s 7th of February, in a week it will be 14th&#8230; Saint Valentine&#8217;s day, so the challenge is to build an Android app that allows you to send a Secret Saint Valentine&#8217;s message.</p>

<p>I have a week to design, implement, test and release this app. Can I do it? well, using Bob the Builder catchphrase: &#8220;Yes, we can!&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea is simple, a person uses the app to send an anonymous message to his secret Valentine. I don&#8217;t really know how the person will receive the message. It will be by email but I&#8217;m not sure of the format yet.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole point is to write a bit about the experience so next time I meet with the QME people, I&#8217;ll have some real data to share with them.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

                        <p>Today I will be giving a workshop about Mobile Apps to the fine people of QME (Queen Mary Entrepreneurs).</p>

<p>The workshop will be focused mainly on planning and designing the app. I think we&#8217;ll have to leave the building part for a second part, follow up, or call it as you want, but if we can leave with a clear idea of what the app has to do it will be a success from my part.</p>

<p>As usual, me being me, I&#8217;ve forgotten half of the stuff I wanted to bring and perhaps I should take my lunch and go home to get all the material. Nothing fancy, post-it notes, pencils, and my video adaptor for my laptop O_0 &lt;&#8211; don&#8217;t panic, I have my good old Mac with me, so we&#8217;re safe  <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />and yes, a quick trip to Rymans can sort the stationery out.</p>

<p>I could have returned to my old grabuma blog, but alas, I wanted something more&#8230; not sure, but going back to blogger seemed wrong.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been willing to write about several things but I couldn&#8217;t find the place. I even consider the fact of writing yet-another-blogging system&#8230; Enough.</p>

<p>Give me a notebook and my pen: I have to write a bit!</p>
