<p>There are times that you have to think fast. There are times you cannot think at all, like when my little boy asked me &#8220;Dad, what is the Internet?&#8221;</p>

<p>My answer then was not great, but I think I manage to send my message. It was something like &#8220;Imagine that the game you play in internet were a building. Imagine as well that the web pages you visit are buildings as well. YouTube? like the cinemas at Wetsfields. yes? He nodded so I took it as if he was following me&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you can see all those websites like buildings, Internet are the roads and streets that take you from one to another. Then you have search engines like Google that are like the tube, that will take you to that far building down there but faster. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8230; it&#8217;s not a place, it&#8217;s the way you go from one place to another?&#8221; &#8220;yup&#8221; &#8220;Oh&#8230; is it that why granddad calls it <strong>The Information Highway</strong>?&#8221;</p>

<p>#facepalm</p>

<p>Next time he asks me something like that I will direct him straight to my dad.</p>

                        <p>Short story long: We get a box of veggies and fruit delivered at home and unfortunately, it has been pinched a couple of times.</p>

<p>Doubt that a box of carrots and apples can look as appealing as an amazon box but it is very annoying to open the door and see that some moron has taken it home.</p>

<p>So, here goes the geek in me to solve the issue: got a raspberry Pi, got an old webcam, got a CCTV installed at home in under an hour.</p>

<p>For the ones who want to do it: the trick is to download motion and compile it in the rbp (the apt-get install motion doesn&#8217;t seem to work that well with loads of webcams).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much else to do: plug the camera, compile &amp; install motion, catch the thief.</p>

<p>(Note: as expected, now that I have my own CCTV system, the hungry has shown up&#8230; or was put off by the green led blinking from the front window)</p>

                        <p>If I talk about CMS everybody who knows the term will think of systems that allow you to manage your on-line assets. Woot? CMS is kind of a horrible term since it&#8217;s wrapped up in many layers of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>CMS is not a web design tool, CMS is not a magic factory to produce websites. CMS systems allow you to manage your content (not your website, do yo see the difference?). Unfortunately for us, humans, there&#8217;s nothing that allow us to manage our online content as consumers.</p>

<p>WordPress is great, suddenly the author of this blog can swap almost any little piece of this blog with a few clicks&#8230; however, the same author is really struggling to manage his bookmarks, rss feeds (now that Google Reader is walking the green mile), pictures, music, and the issue goes on.</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t you notice? it is your content, but it has turn into their business!</p>

<p>So, let me ask you this: when, as users, did we decide to delegate the responsibility of managing our on-line content on third parties that did whatever they liked / wanted?</p>

<p>Companies that when their time arrived, they left us all by the side of the road looking confused, lost and sad.</p>

<p>I agree, del.icio.us was great.. until they died. Nobody thought that Google would kill Reader but they did and now that uneasy feeling of me delegating my on-line content on third parties is turning into a terrible itch. My on-line resources are part of my business.</p>

<p>I am who I am and I do what I do because of my information.</p>

<p>Reader&#8217;s Assassination is the last straw. My content cannot be left in hands of companies that look at me as their way of making money. Turning Users into a comodity is a high risk game. I agree, not many people will desert all these Free Services (because they are free), but every time you use a free service remind yourself the price you will have to pay to move away. Sometimes, paying is the cheapest way to freedom.</p>

<p>Call me stupid but I&#8217;ve been building a CMS. A different kind of CMS, a CMS that allows me to manage my content. Perhaps it&#8217;s not as sparkly and shiny as all these other services, but look at this: it&#8217;s mine. I have total control over it. My content is nobody&#8217;s business any more.</p>

<p>This CMS is called :blibb and it&#8217;s a bit early to open it up to the masses but if you are interested on trying a very early version just let me know.</p>

                        <p>London is HARD. That&#8217;s the message I always send to the Spaniards who ask me about coming to live and work to this city. London has far too many things to offer but there&#8217;s also a high price you have to pay (have you looked at the rental prices lately?).</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not only money. London is expensive but so it is Barcelona or Paris.</p>

<p>What it really makes this city so special is the people (I know, I know, bear with me). The first difference young people notice with any other city is the incredible amount of young people who lives here. The second one is that many people come to London not to settle down, which makes this city the perfect place for flings, affairs and passionate one night stands.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not about how easy is to get laid in this city, ok, it is&#8230; O_0 and about work. I don&#8217;t  tweet job offers any more, at the end of the day, I&#8217;m not a recruiter but if you want to come to this city to find a job, let me know.</p>

<p>For example, while having coffee this morning a guy asked if I knew of a python developer looking for a job. Another guy spat out  &#8220;<em>Python developers don&#8217;t look for jobs, they all have jobs</em>&#8221; and we all laughed (we all do python and we all have jobs, so the guy was not that wrong, was he?)</p>

                        <p>Hace un tiempo tuve la idea de organizar un evento de programadores para programadores. Lo llame 8Dev y se suponía que iba a organizarse en Mallorca. La idea era simple, coger 8 programadores de puta madre de por aquí, meterlos en un avión y que explicaran lo que hacían a los programadores españoles. Incluso llegamos a hablar con <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Knopper">Klaus Knopper</a> para que asistiera, y si no recuerdo mal, hasta conseguimos un par de sponsors (uno era Microsoft, a la que no le hacía mucha gracia el tema Knopper, pero aún así dijo que contaramos con ellos). Hablamos con Atlassian para ver si se subirían al carro pero al final todo se derrumbó.</p>

<p>Organizar algo en España cuando vives en Londres es, por ponerlo en una palabra, complicado. Pero tal vez lo que más me sorprendió fue la actitud de muchos de los programadores a los que les pregunté qué le parecía un evento así&#8230; pero eso, como dice <a href="http://www.bonillaware.com/">el Bonilla</a>, es otra historia.</p>

<p>Recientemente mande un tweet sobre organizar un Spanish Day en el Google Campus y para gran sorpresa mía, varias personas no sólo respondieron sinó que me ofrecieron su ayuda y yo, desde aquí, os lo agradezco enormemente.</p>

<p>Tuve una breve charla con <a href="https://twitter.com/ediggs">Eze Vidra</a>, Head of Google Campus, y la idea de organizar un evento con Startups españolas le pareció genial!</p>

<p>Evidentemente yo, siendo yo, me puse a pensar en lo que se podría organizar y fue en ese momento que me di cuenta que a lo mejor el tal Ries tenía razón y deberia echar el freno y (releerme el capítulo de su libro sobre MVPs) y un cafe y medio después y varios folios garabateados llegué a la conclusión que lo mejor era preguntarle aquí al respetable si les interesaría.</p>

<p>Eze sólo dijo que oranizaramos lo que organicemos se ha de pensar en el aforo, así que aquí lanzo mi pregunta:</p>

<p>¿Startups españolas, os interesaría participar en un evento en el Google Campus?</p>

<p>Si la respuesta es sí, poneros en contacto conmigo ya sea mediante mi <a href="http://twitter.com/ipedrazas">twitter</a>, o un emilio  de toda la vida (ivan at este dominio) o incluso un simple comentario.</p>

<p>After a week near Barcelona where I tried not to write any code&#8230; I came back with a very diffuse idea of what should I do next. I knew what I wanted, I knew where I wanted to go, but I had no idea of the route.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ve just got the green line from the financial team (read, my wife) to enrol in the next crazy idea: a mobile app for the wedding of a friend!</p>

<p>Come on, guys, after Saint Valentine, it was clear that it had to be a wedding&#8230; wasn&#8217;t it?</p>

                        <p>In my last post I gave a few figures about how many installations, messages, and more. Between all those numbers there was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>78 visits to the app page (78.71% from Twitter, 8.17% from Facebook, 0% from G+)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this, my friends, it&#8217;s why you all should have the best communicators driving your corporate twitter accounts.</p>

<p>Ok, let&#8217;s be honest here. I really thought that Facebook would be 0 and that Google Plus would be closer to twitter&#8230; and I was wrong. Very wrong.</p>

<p>Google must be doing something very wrong to not driving traffic like that. 0%? that&#8217;s absolute rubbish!</p>

<p>Bear in mind that I posted to different G+ circles with, in total, thousands of people. Result: 0</p>

<p>I use Facebook ONLY for family and close friends&#8230; so, don&#8217;t get offended if I don&#8217;t know you very well and I don&#8217;t accept your facebook request&#8230; and now remember that me being Spanish and spaniards not mastering English it&#8217;s kind of foreseeable that not much traffic will come from Facebook&#8230; still, almost a 10% came from it.</p>

<p>Let me remind you that Thousands in G+ were trumped by a handful of Facebook friends, and completely smashed by Twitter. Google, you&#8217;re doing something very wrong.</p>

<p>Did we say Twitter? well, I have less than 400 followers, but I managed to get 78 clicks. 72 of which came from Twitter&#8230; So, 1 in 5 of my followers clicked my link. Will be good to know if this percentage scale but I&#8217;m afraid it will not, still 20% of my followers visiting the app page is awesome!</p>

<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<p>What can we learn from this? Twitter is a wicked for promotion. Forget Facebook, Ignore Google Plus. Tweet, Tweet, Tweet!</p>

<p>Anyone in the room fancy sharing their experiences?</p>

                        <p>Almost a week ago and I&#8217;ve said a word about My Secret Valentine project&#8230; yet. you will have to excuse me but I&#8217;ve been a bit busy. Things of having to deal with children during Half Term.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get into the story. Last week I published a very little app that the only thing that did was to send a (not very pretty, have to reckon) message and a picture by email.</p>

<p>Total numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">30 installations in 7 countries (UK, Spain, USA, Ireland, Netherlands, Panama, Ukraine)</span></li>
<li>89 Valentines sent</li>
<li>8 Uninstalls (after 14th of February)</li>
<li>78 visits to the app page (78.71% from Twitter, 8.17% from Facebook, 0% from G+).</li>
</ul>

<p>I used <a href="http://karmacracy.com/">Karmacrazy</a> to check how many people went to the Play page. In case you don&#8217;t know, Google doesn&#8217;t let you track how many people visit your app&#8217;s page. But as I said, no analytics? no problem. In fact, you can take a look to the link stats to see the kind of information you can get from this tool.</p>

<p>If you want to give it a go, use this <a href="http://kcy.me/fo6q">link</a>.</p>

<p>More numbers. Android Versions. And this is kind of a surprise, because in the last Droidcon we talked loooong time about legacy android versions and here we have the proof of what&#8217;s the biggest problem with Android so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stats-msv.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52" alt="stats-msv" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stats-msv.png" width="985" height="364" /></a>As you can see the top version is the very old 2.3.x followed by all the 4s. I fact, if we unify all the Jelly Bean devices we see that 75% of the devices are running Jelly Bean. However, who&#8217;s going to shut the door to 30% of their potential customers?</p>

<p>For those who are prone to slag Android think about it. Updates don&#8217;t come from Google, updates come from your carriers. The more the Android device has been customised, the harder it will be to update. Why so many devices still on 2.3.x ? because of the 24m contracts, of course.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes when I&#8217;m out with my children people makes comments about how busy we must be with three little monsters. Yes, we are&#8230; but there&#8217;s nothing you cannot solve with a bit of organisation, loads of patience and chocolate. Bribing is a must!</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ID-10081433.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-44" alt="ID-10081433" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ID-10081433-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>

<p>But there&#8217;s a particular case that gest the whole thing wrong: Parents with only one child. They think that one child takes so much time, that 3 will take at least 3 times more.</p>

<p>Very Wrong.</p>

<p>Children, like a team, don&#8217;t add up but mix. It&#8217;s all about how well organised you are and don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s not about planning 2 weeks ahead, it&#8217;s about planning what are they going to do next or tomorrow, not in 2 weeks, or summer. Yes, registering for summer camps, like managing training of your team has to be done with plenty of time.</p>

<p>Managing software projects and managing children is quite similar. There are very big unknowns. Planning two weeks ahead makes not much sense. Alas, planning what are they going to do after school is never easy because you never know how tired they will be, or which mood they will come out with&#8230; Plan this big dinner to find out that they had this massive Birthday party and they&#8217;ve been fuelled by sugar and noise&#8230; So, yes, you have to plan, planning is key&#8230; as much as being able to be flexible an improvise.</p>

<p>How? software development left in hands of improvisation? well, don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s not the improvisation that comes with &#8220;Don&#8217;t have a clue&#8230; let&#8217;s try this&#8221; but the improvisation that comes with experience of being now and there. Key is to plan this or that and if it fails (for any reason) do that other thing or try this other approach.</p>

<p>So, here we are, it&#8217;s not about reading the right books, it&#8217;s about doing the wrong thing and learning from it. Notice the LEARN bit&#8230; any parent with children know their children very well, so when they come home with a foul mood, or tired or XXXX they know how to smooth the transition from school to bed, or how I tell my wife, Bed deployment was success. All unit tests are green, house is quiet.</p>

<p>She text back something along the lines &#8220;nerd! &#8230; love you&#8221;</p>

<p>Life is never easy, but it&#8217;s about being flexible</p>

                        <p>Pictures, I need Pictures!</p>

<p>Ok, let me explain myself. Since Thursday I&#8217;ve been building a simple Android App for Saint Valentine. As original as I am, I called it &#8220;<strong>My Secret Valentine</strong>&#8221; but if you&#8217;re following this blog, you know already that.</p>

<p>The idea of the app is to be able to send a picture and a message to&#8230; your secret valentine!</p>

<p>Now, the app allows you to access your telephone gallery, so your valentine message can be as personal and intimate as you want.</p>

<p>As well, I had thought about putting a few pictures inside the app so people who are not that good photographers (even Instagram I guess will have loads to say about it) could send pretty messages as well.</p>

<p>Now, time is ticking, so, this is my call, could you be so kind to send me some beautiful pictures so I can put them in my app?</p>

<p>If everything goes as expected, I&#8217;ll be putting the app in the market tomorrow&#8230; so, yes, time is REALLY ticking!</p>

<p>Btw, I can update the app at any moment, and I&#8217;m more than happy to add them at any point.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, one last thing. Your pictures have to have at least a copyleft license. And yes, I will be putting up a page with everybody who contributed to it.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example of a message sent from the app:</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenshot2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-37" alt="screenshot2" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenshot2-300x187.png" width="300" height="187" /></a> <a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenshoot1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-38" alt="screenshoot1" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenshoot1-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>So, yes, if you want people sending their Valentines using one of your astonishing pictures, just get in contact with me.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day!</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the app is free and open source and there are no revenue created by or from the app or images (nope, there are no adds neither), but the really good thing is all the stuff I&#8217;m going to write about it.</p>
