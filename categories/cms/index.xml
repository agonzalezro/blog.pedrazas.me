      <description>&lt;p&gt;This last week has been a bit crazy with all the new stuff that is going on but&amp;#8230; if last week was mayhem, get ready because this week is hardware week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://london.hackspace.org.uk/&#34;&gt;London Hackspace&lt;/a&gt;  to see what do they do and &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; it would make any sense to join them. I will unveil an idea that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for the last weeks. One of the things that I&amp;#8217;ve learnt during these last 2 years is that no idea is good if no money can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that making money is &amp;#8220;the business part&amp;#8221; of the idea and I&amp;#8217;ve been tempted to write a post about that in reply to a conversation that was triggered in Twitter by the fine people of Klicap. However, time is precious and &amp;#8220;Talking is easy&amp;#8221; so, my new motto is &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Make More, Talk Less&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; (not that this many people are listening).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super exciting times where I have to deal with Software and Hardware and the close relationship between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pre-holidays week is all about hardware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapsberry Pis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And :blibb that we could say it&amp;#8217;s the glue that ties them together. As I said&amp;#8230; Exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>:blibb a Content Manager for humans</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I talk about CMS everybody who knows the term will think of systems that allow you to manage your on-line assets. Woot? CMS is kind of a horrible term since it&amp;#8217;s wrapped up in many layers of misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMS is not a web design tool, CMS is not a magic factory to produce websites. CMS systems allow you to manage your content (not your website, do yo see the difference?). Unfortunately for us, humans, there&amp;#8217;s nothing that allow us to manage our online content as consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress is great, suddenly the author of this blog can swap almost any little piece of this blog with a few clicks&amp;#8230; however, the same author is really struggling to manage his bookmarks, rss feeds (now that Google Reader is walking the green mile), pictures, music, and the issue goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;#8217;t you notice? it is your content, but it has turn into their business!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let me ask you this: when, as users, did we decide to delegate the responsibility of managing our on-line content on third parties that did whatever they liked / wanted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that when their time arrived, they left us all by the side of the road looking confused, lost and sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, del.icio.us was great.. until they died. Nobody thought that Google would kill Reader but they did and now that uneasy feeling of me delegating my on-line content on third parties is turning into a terrible itch. My on-line resources are part of my business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am who I am and I do what I do because of my information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader&amp;#8217;s Assassination is the last straw. My content cannot be left in hands of companies that look at me as their way of making money. Turning Users into a comodity is a high risk game. I agree, not many people will desert all these Free Services (because they are free), but every time you use a free service remind yourself the price you will have to pay to move away. Sometimes, paying is the cheapest way to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call me stupid but I&amp;#8217;ve been building a CMS. A different kind of CMS, a CMS that allows me to manage my content. Perhaps it&amp;#8217;s not as sparkly and shiny as all these other services, but look at this: it&amp;#8217;s mine. I have total control over it. My content is nobody&amp;#8217;s business any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CMS is called :blibb and it&amp;#8217;s a bit early to open it up to the masses but if you are interested on trying a very early version just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
