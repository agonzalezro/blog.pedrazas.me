                        <p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bitcoin-logo-1000_0.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-271" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bitcoin-logo-1000_0-300x300.jpg" alt="bitcoin-logo-1000_0" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>Last month I decided that it was time for Bitcoin and I to spend more quality time together. So I went to <a href="http://www.megamine.com/">MegaMine</a> and opened an account. Why Megamine and not some others? well, truth is that they are local. It&#8217;s a Startup from London, you can go and visit them. Depending on the time of the day they will buy you a coffee or a beer and have a nice chat with you&#8230; and yes, their prices are super competitive!</p>

<p>I bumped into them because I was looking for a cheap datacenter to host my machines to build my OpenStack Empire, but that&#8217;s another story. Let&#8217;s focus!</p>

<p>If you want to get into Bitcoins there are two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can mine Bitcoins, aka Bitcoin mining</li>
<li>You can buy Bitcoins. In the same way that you would buy any other foreign currency.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main difference is the price. Buying Bitcoins is like buying US Dollars, or British Pounds. (Buying and selling prices are different.) When mining you pay for the usage of a mining machine (or a pool), regardless of the price of the Bitcoin (well, that&#8217;s the theory). This means that under certain circumstances, buying Bitcoin is more convenient that mining.</p>

<p>buying Bitcoin is not as straightforward as many people think. Yes, there are places where you can go and buy Bitcoins. for example, <a href="https://bitbargain.co.uk/buy">this website</a>. Now, if you notice, the website does not sell Bitcoins, the website will allow you to buy Bitcoins (from someone else), and because of that, every transaction has different conditions (looks dodgy, doesn&#8217;t it?)</p>

<p>At the beginning of the month SatoshiPoint presented their machines and I rushed to go and compare what I could get from them compared to what I could get from mining.</p>

<p>The difference was that the machines will give you your bitcoin straightaway (in reality it the transaction took around 13 minutes to go through) compared to the 5~ish days that I had to spend mining to get the same amount of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>As I see it, if you want your Bitcoins now, go and buy them out of some place. Make sure the website is the one selling the Bitcoins and not-yet-another-middle-man-in-the-middle.</p>

<p>If you want to squeeze your money and get a higher return&#8230; <a href="http://www.megamine.com/pricing.php">go and mine</a>!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if Megamine will sell Bitcoins in the future or not, but I will be asking them next time I see them for a coffee or a beer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy Mining!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I&#8217;m not related to Megamine in any way nor they give me any satoshis to write about them (although any offered will be most welcome!).</p>

  <p>
    It’s not a secret that <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> changed my life as a developer. I&#8217;m sure that if you know me, you will have heard me talking about how great vagrant is.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Vagrant, in case that you don’t know, it’s a little tool that allows you to develop locally an execute your code inside a Virtual Machine. This, of course, gives you the advantage of not needing to setup your own machine (a painful activity that we all have been suffering in silence for years). In a nutshell, vagrant helps you to decouple your development environment from your workstation.

  <p>
    Now, we cannot say that there’s a new guy in the block, because <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> has been around for a while (ehem…) but we do can say that Docker is not only going to change my life but it’s about to change everyone’s life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Docker will change the way we run and distribute applications.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don’t think I’m the right person to explain what Docker is. I can tell you how it has changed the way I work, or to put it differently, to change the things I do, but if you really want to understand how Docker works, it&#8217;s better you look at the resources at the bottom of the page.

<p><p>
    Docker is a linux container that allows you to run an application with a simple &#8220;RUN&#8221; command. Yes, there are a few other parameter but the idea is that you can launch an app (that it&#8217;s self contained) with a single command.
  </p></p>

<p><p>
    If you haven&#8217;t suffered the enlighting experience of trying to run a web application like WordPress, for example, you don&#8217;t know how complex things can turn very quickly. The ammount of software and things that have to be &#8220;in place&#8221; and configured properly is painful. How Docker can help you there? well, someone, for example me, will spend some time building a Docker image so people like you can just run it with a simple command.
  </p></p>

<p><p>
    Docker will lower the sys admin barrier. People who doesn&#8217;t know much about how to set up a web server suddenly can run their own wordpress instance (which is the idea behind of all those VPS with &#8220;one-click install&#8221;).
  </p></p>

<p><p>
    But there&#8217;s more, with Docker creating a cluster it’s easy. Ok, not trivial, but very feasible. Do you remember those complicated architectures you have seen in books? now you can build them in your laptop. I agree, a cluster under work load behaves very different than a cluster you could run in your workstation, but let’s face it, the fact that you can use docker to build a cluster of machines will help to speed up the future development of applications and solutions.
  </p></p>

<p><p>
    So, what I have been doing with Docker that has changed the way I see things?
  </p></p>

<p><p>
    well, I’m writing<a href="http://dotmarks.net"> a little tool </a>to manage bookmarks. The App has two provisioning tools. Vagrant (of course) and ansible scripts to deploy and configure the app in a VPS (like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=56ae0600c4bc">Digital Ocean</a>, for example).
  </p>
</div></p>

<div id="wmd-preview-section-6" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content" style="color: #162029;">
  <h3 id="dotmarks">
    .dotMarks
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The whole idea of this app is to self-host your bookmarks. Yes, I know, nobody seems to use bookmarks nowadays but that&#8217;s a different story. The idea is that you run it in your machine… and because of that you can see how Docker can make my life much easier: It’s like giving people an executable that they can run. Everything is self-contained and pre-configured. It’s perfect, it&#8217;s Awesome!
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="dotmarks">
    What about me?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    By default I run 3 docker containers in my machine. One with the <a href="https://github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui" target="_blank">Dockerui</a> (A web interface for Docker), <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ipedrazas/elasticsearch/">One with ElasticSearch</a> and one with MongoDB. I still use Vagrant to develop and run .dotMarks, but once it&#8217;s ready, I can tell you, it will run in its own docker container.

    Where do we go from here
  </h3>
  
  <p style="color: #162029;">
    Good question. As I see it, there are three areas that are not under the Docker Radar but I think that once the right people understand the potential it will go through as a freight train:
  </p>
  
  <ul style="color: #162029;">
    <li>
      <strong>Education:</strong> From the newbies that they need a (safe) playground to land, to the more experienced guy who wants to understand complex architectures, Docker has a huge potential in (self) education.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Application Distribution:</strong> WebApps are awesome, but distributing them is quite a pain… in fact, not many people do that because let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s hard. It’s not only shipping the code, it&#8217;s configuring the servers, and running the whole lot and… it’s complicated. Docker will bring a standard way of distributing applications. From wordpress to the latest trendy idea someone pushes to Github&#8230; I&#8217;m sure developers will start including Dockerfiles to their repos once they understand the wonders of linux containers
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Support and Quality Control:</strong> Suddenly, testing applications in the real architecture locally is suddenly possible. Do you have customers with your system installed in-house. Replicating their environtment is a matter of linking images in a Dockerfile.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="color: #162029;">
    But don&#8217;t get too carried away, Docker has its amaizing Use Cases but it&#8217;s not for everyone. Yes, developers and SysAdmins love it&#8230; time will say if it will become mainstream.
  </p>

<p>y se monta una saludable discusión sobre si los eventos de sólo chicas son sexistas o no. Hay dos bandos, los que creen que hay que <a href="https://twitter.com/juanriaza/status/475916574382362624">integrar</a> a las mujeres en los eventos actuales, y los que opinan que lo importante es que las mujeres se sientan cómodas en un entorno técnico.</p>

<p>Que para nada era un ataque a Javi, y si te he ofendido, desde aquí te pido mis más sinceras disculpas&#8230; sinó todo lo contrario. Por que el problema de fondo del sexismo, o discriminación sexual no es que yo organice un evento &#8220;sólo para chicas&#8221;, si no en lo que es un ejemplo de libro de algo conocido como &#8220;Discrimación Benevolente&#8221;, dónde una mujer ha de justificar que vayan a quedar un grupo de chicas &#8220;para programar y aprender&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yo he organizado algún evento y la verdad, nunca he sentido la necesidad de justificarlo en plan &#8220;sólo somos unos amigos que vamos a quedar para ver como Maven descarga medio internet y para luego escupir un OutOfMemoryException o algo peor&#8221;.</p>

<p>No nos engañemos, el origen del problema no está en las mujeres que quieren hacer quedadas para chicas, si no en la sociedad (de la que todos formamos parte) donde el poder sigue estando en manos masculinas.</p>

<p>Mi comentario a Javi no era una reprimenda, si no todo lo contrario, el mensaje era &#8220;Mira, Javi&#8230; cuando una persona ha de justificar sus decisiones, entonces es cuando hemos perdido, pues la justificación denota inferioridad. Y eso no es bueno &#8220;, que de haber twitteado esto, seguro que la conversación hubiera sido más tranquila, pero oigan, uno es como es&#8230; y &#8220;no me cabía&#8221; que como excusa peregrina pues eso, es peregrina.</p>

<p>Uno de los mensajes más potentes del <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YesAllWomen&amp;src=tyah">#YesAllWomen</a> es la batalla diaria que supone ser mujer en un mundo masculino.</p>

<p>El problema de fondo, como bien dice Yamila, es algo mucho más grande, gordo y horroroso&#8230; nivel Cthulhu&#8230; por lo menos.<a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Great-cthulhu.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-224" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Great-cthulhu.jpg" alt="Great-cthulhu" width="540" height="405" /></a></p>

<p>Pero eso es <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_Cthulhu">otra historia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notas</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sí, tuve que mirar como se deletrea Cthulhu&#8230; mis geek levels por los suelos :_(</li>
<li>Para confirmar el estado de la situación&#8230; usemos Google:</li>
<li>Busca &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=chicas&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jbaVU5qDJuTK0QWHnoHYCQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=921">chicas</a>&#8221; y horrorizate con los resultados. Has de contar 48 imágenes antes de encontrar una imagen de una chica &#8220;normal&#8221; (atención que haya tenido que usar este palabro al lado de chica).</li>
<li>Busca &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=solo+chicas&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jbaVU5qDJuTK0QWHnoHYCQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=921">solo chicas</a>&#8220;, y una vez más, horrotizate.</li>
<li>Ahora, hagámoslo del revés. Busquemos &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=chicos&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jbaVU5qDJuTK0QWHnoHYCQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=921">chicos</a>&#8220;: Anda, pero si la mitad de las fotos son chicas&#8230; Vale, que haya una revista que se llame chicos no ayuda</li>

<li><strong>Moraleja</strong>: cuando las dos búsquedas devuelvan resultados equivalentes (que no iguales), entonces hablaremos de igualdad, mientras tanto, y la proxima vez que te veas en medio de un sexism flame war, recuerda que Google, casi nunca se equivoca&#8230;  <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />(sí, esto es una puerta abierta a &#8220;Troll me Plenty&#8221;).</li>

                        <p>Sharing information is not easy. We are animals of customs. Moving from one way of doing things to another takes time and it creates friction and it happens, over time that we accept the new way of doing things as the &#8220;way we do this&#8221;.</p>

<p>Working with a distributed team is strange. my team is not exactly distributed, but asynchronous. Working with people whoe are not next to you creates a barrier, but opens up tons of possibilities.</p>

<p>My wife recently asked  advise about how to deal with a distributed and/or asynchronous team. Technically we have so many options that it&#8217;s difficult to know which is the right choice.</p>

<p>These are the applications that in my experience, make a distributed async team to be as productive as working together elbow to elbow:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Serialised Chat:</strong> a chat where people can see the last 4 days of history. Chats are not only useful to &#8220;chat&#8221; but to keep track of what was going on.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Blogs:</strong> This is the core of a team. Every single team should have an internal blog where they dump what&#8217;s happening. I know, it seems the same than the chat, but it&#8217;s not. Chats are prone to off topics and and are terriffic to let people know. Blogs allow transmitting info and gathering comments dead easy.</li>
<li><strong>Skype/hangouts:</strong> not much to say here really. There are times that a simple phone call can sort out many problems.</li>
<li><strong>Wiki:</strong> nothing beats the good old wiki to create a solid knowledge base.</li>
<li><strong>Github:</strong> git it&#8217;s not only great for code, but for anything you need to pull-request</li>
<li><strong>Dropbox:</strong> sharing made easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do have tried things like basecamp, yammer or jive and they are great but they do not fit very well with small teams.</p>

<p>I will not talk about 3D printing here, I will talk about a side effect of having a 3D printer at home.</p>

<p>My children sees the printer as a wonderful toy generator machine&#8230; and I have to recognise that the little people have veritable passion for the plastic moulded stuff: look at their toys!</p>

<p>Anyway, to the point!</p>

<p>Yesterday my boy came to me with a list. He was looking at the list and mumbling some words when I asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-200" alt="" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a>He showed me that list. It was a list of names and words and numbers that made no sense at the beginning&#8230; then he explained his business idea to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sell toys at school, dad&#8230; and this is the list of the people who wants to buy things from me&#8221;.</p>

<p>Suddenly the odd list made sense:</p>

<p>It was the name of a child, the name of the toys and the price they had to pay for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get rich selling toys, dad&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled and asked him if he had considered how much it cost to produce the toys and he looked at me puzzled:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s free, dad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the fact that you don&#8217;t pay anything it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s free&#8221; (my mind drifted to all this web services that were supposedly free in exchange of &#8220;some&#8221; of your data&#8230;)</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/minion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-205" alt="minion" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/minion-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>I tried to explain to him how he could calculate and how much he should charge for every toy&#8230; I could see he lost interest quickly &#8220;makes no sense, dad&#8230; I cannot put a different price to any toy, I will need two lists, one for my toys and one for the children&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed you will need, my dear&#8230; That&#8217;s exactly how shops all over the world work. You have a list with stock and prices and a list of customers&#8230;</p>

<p>Conversation moved on and we left the little toy factory aside but when I went to bed I told my wife &#8220;darling, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re breeding Entrepreneurs&#8221; and last night, last night I slept well.</p>

                        <p>This last week has been a bit crazy with all the new stuff that is going on but&#8230; if last week was mayhem, get ready because this week is hardware week.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will go to the <a href="https://london.hackspace.org.uk/">London Hackspace</a>  to see what do they do and <strong>IF</strong> it would make any sense to join them. I will unveil an idea that I&#8217;ve been working on for the last weeks. One of the things that I&#8217;ve learnt during these last 2 years is that no idea is good if no money can be made.</p>

<p>I agree that making money is &#8220;the business part&#8221; of the idea and I&#8217;ve been tempted to write a post about that in reply to a conversation that was triggered in Twitter by the fine people of Klicap. However, time is precious and &#8220;Talking is easy&#8221; so, my new motto is &#8220;<strong>Make More, Talk Less</strong>&#8221; (not that this many people are listening).</p>

<p>Super exciting times where I have to deal with Software and Hardware and the close relationship between them.</p>

<p>This pre-holidays week is all about hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arduino</li>
<li>Rapsberry Pis</li>
<li>NFC</li>
</ul>

<p>And :blibb that we could say it&#8217;s the glue that ties them together. As I said&#8230; Exciting!</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;ve been waiting a loooong time before unleashing my (very reduced) arduino skills in order to build something wicked.</p>

<p>Arduino is great for learning and&#8230; for building THAT CRAZY IDEA.</p>

<p>First idea was about using solar energy with arduinos but since I work at night&#8230; I think I&#8217;ll have to postpone that one a little bit.</p>

<p>From all the arduinos the one that really ticks my box is the lilypad. Yup, the wearable arduino is the one I&#8217;ve been more willing to lay my hands on.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lilypad.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-187" alt="lilypad" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lilypad-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>So, what is the project about?</p>

<p>Well, I like cycling and I like gadgets&#8230; and if there&#8217;s something that a bicycle doesn&#8217;t have is a proper signaling system, so this is my idea: A jacket that will have a signaling/messaging system.</p>

<p>I know, there are some projects already out there trying to achive having a more secure cycle ride, but they are not very usable.</p>

<p>My efforts are not making something that works. My efforts are aimed to build something usable. Something useful. Something beautiful.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;m experimenting with arduino and the <a href="http://www.veear.eu/products/easyvr-arduino-shield/">Easy VR Shield</a>. The idea is very simple: you give voice commands to your jacket like &#8220;<strong>RIGHT</strong>&#8221; or &#8220;<strong>LEFT</strong>&#8221; and the jacket will light up a <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> sign for a few seconds.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what people would call an MVP, then, of course, there&#8217;s room for more fancy stuff like displaying messages to our fellow drivers&#8230; but this will come later, for now, let&#8217;s get the prototype working.</p>

<p>Anyway, I need to find a nice name for the project so, if you have a good idea for it, <a href="http://twitter.com/ipedrazas">share it with me</a>, please <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>I have talked about <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> already in this blog (<a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/?p=136">here</a> and <a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/?p=155">here</a>) but if you have looked at Vagrant and you&#8217;re not using it yet because you &#8220;didn&#8217;t get it&#8221; let me tell you how I did it.</p>

<p>Books are great for building this baseline of knowledge. They have the advantage of curated structure and the disadvantage of getting outdated&#8230; but since my memory is quite terrible, what I want from a book is a better understanding of the technology and not how to type that command.</p>

<p>For the accurate sintaxis and instructions I fall back to google  <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />What I do is the following. When I&#8217;m going to learn something new I always start a new project where I can use that technology.</p>

<p>My projects are structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">prod</span></li>
<li>lab</li>
<li>test</li>
</ul>

<p>So, depending what I&#8217;m going to do I add an entry to test (if it&#8217;s a quick test that can be deleted at any time) or to lab if it&#8217;s a project I want to use to learn a new technology. There&#8217;s nothing like building to get the learning going <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>For example, I&#8217;m building Cryptadoo as the way of learning Django, or with Grails I created my &#8220;Rewards&#8221; project.</p>

<p>Vagrant is different because you cannot build something, but it helps you to develop better. Still, I created a project with AngularJS to test Vagrant (ServerMarks).</p>

<p>For me the book provides a solid foundation for day to day use of Vagrant, with plenty of guidance for getting into more advanced usage. Automation is encouraged by Vagrant&#8217;s workflows, I would say even more: Automation is encourage in general.</p>

<p>New users and people with zero Vagrant experience will be able to pick up this book and learn everything they need to start using Vagrant and getting the most out of it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, this book will help you loads because it illustrates the best use cases of Vagrant. I agree, the fact that V1.0 and V1.1 or V2.0 have some incompatibilities will force you to go out and look for the right command, but as I said before, books can get outdated pretty quickly, but there&#8217;s something that books give you than none of your random search will do: structure&#8230; and hey, you can read them without Internet connection for example: while commuting <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>If you want a step by step tutorial this <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026358.do">Vagrant Up and Running</a> will help you little, but as a way to accelerate learning it&#8217;s a wonderful book!</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Recently me and my wife have been having some problems with Internet and Children. I know, there are hundreds of filters and ways of preventing children to access content that it not appropriate to their age&#8230; and none seems to work well.</p>

<p>You can enable <a href="http://www.google.com/preferences">Safe Search</a> in Google and YouTube Safety Mode. Let me show you acouple of Image Searches by Mighty Google with the Safe Search On, I searched for &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=990&amp;q=human+rights">Human Rights</a>&#8220;:</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Selection_021.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-165" alt="Google Search" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Selection_021-300x140.png" width="300" height="140" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Selection_020.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-164" alt="Google Search" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Selection_020-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></a></p>

<p>So, yes, almost all the images are &#8220;safe&#8221;&#8230; almost. Thing is, if you disable that safe search the results contain less blood.</p>

<p>Other options are using a proxy that filters out the dodgy content but not many people know how to install those things that have evolved into add-ons or extensions that filter out certain pages.</p>

<p>The issue with those solutions is that you rely on a company that gathers your browsing data (and your children&#8217;s browsing data) and all of them have long Terms and Conditions and what really worries me is that as a company, you need to make money. Since they give away their product, I&#8217;m afraid that the real product is the user&#8217;s data.</p>

<p>So, as parents we have some options. But it&#8217;s not what us as parents can do, but what our children are going to do. An example would be WoT, a great idea with a big problem: children don&#8217;t understand it. WoT</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;crowdsources ratings from a global community of millions of users, who rate and comment on websites based on their personal experiences&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wicked! Now when I search I see that little green/red icon next to the results&#8230; Do you think that children understand that? me neither.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think it is a great idea and it is the way to go. They have options to &#8220;<em>Block sites that are unsuitable for children</em>&#8220;. So, in many ways it is better than using Mighty Google and its Safe Search.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-30-233411.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-167" alt="WoT" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-30-233411-300x267.png" width="300" height="267" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately WoT is not only focused on Children safety which is good and bad&#8230; but it is a great idea and I will be looking at them (and their API) more closely.</p>

<p>One of the best Add-ons for Firefox or Chrome is Web Filter by <a href="http://www.cloudacl.com/">CloudAcl</a>. It allows you Black List or White List websites. A parents/kids mode and it&#8217;s password protected&#8230; and they have a mobile version for your iPhone/iPad or your Android device.</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Selection_022.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-173" alt="CloudAcl" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Selection_022-296x300.png" width="296" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>Another option is to use a &#8220;Kid&#8217;s Safe Browser&#8221; like <a href="http://www.kidzui.com/">KidZui</a>. Again, this is a great tool with the only issue of why do they need to gather and keep browsing history in their servers and not keep it in MY BROWSER!!! (the fact that they do that is a big red flag, since technically there&#8217;s no reason for taking my data somewhere else and by doing that your message is &#8220;I do it because that&#8217;s how I make money&#8221;. Again, me and my children are the product not the customer.</p>

<p>As it seems, the options out there are not as good as we might expect. Or they are not as efficient as we would like to or they are not specialised in children&#8217;s browing or they have a dodgy business model.</p>

<p>What <strong>I would like</strong> is to have an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open source solution</span> that stops my children from seeing things that are not appropriate for them. I&#8217;d like to have also a tool that allows me easily to monitor what is going on when I&#8217;m not there browsing with them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s such thing, what I know is that I haven&#8217;t found it yet&#8230;  Since I like technology and specially <a href="www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pis</a>, I&#8217;m building a plug and play device that I call <strong>SafeBerry Pi</strong> and it&#8217;s basically the monitoring tool. Still very early stages but worry not, I will be writing about it as soon as I have something (stable) working, so, stay tunned!!</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you monitor your cron jobs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We just don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monitoring is one of those things that yo should do: monitor EVERYTHING&#8230; or at least as much as you can.</p>

<p>One of the most slippery cases are our cron jobs. Many of them don&#8217;t report anything, many of them run without anyone knowing they&#8217;re there&#8230; And even worse, if they fail, they fail silently: as this cron job I disabled because it had been failing since 2008 (only 5 years or every day failures).</p>

<p>That was the last straw, after removing that entry from the crontab I went to my boss and we decided to tackle the problem. This client uses Nimbus but it seems that the Nimbus guy was not very happy on having loads of cron jobs added so I suggested using Jenkins.</p>

<p>In this case we decided to use Free Style Software Projects since they allow us to run the cron job manually</p>
